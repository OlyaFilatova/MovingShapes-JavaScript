# Moving shapes (JavaScript)

There is a canvas that is stretched to entire screen and is filled with different figures: triangles, circles, recatngles.

Shapes are moving, rotating, bumping into each other, and changing angle of their movement and rotation.

Collisions are detected using SAT.

FULL OF BUGS:
Collision detection is not very well maintained with circles.
Sometimes shapes clutch together and drug each other.
Sometimes shapes hustle through shapes that are not moving anywhere(static).
